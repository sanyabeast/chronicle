The program is a 3D model file viewer that supports mainstream formats like gltf, glb, fbx, and obj. However, support is planned to be expanded in the future. 
It works on all platforms since it's built on top of Electron and uses a graphics renderer based on three.js. 
All primary and additional viewer functions for 3D are supported - including all types of navigation and scene lighting control. 
Animations, lighting, and cameras are all supported, and there are several inspection display modes available.
