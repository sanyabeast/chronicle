## Overview

A modern implementation of the classic Match-3 puzzle game, originally created in 2013 and now refactored to TypeScript. This project holds historical significance as it was the first game fully completed from start to finish. The original JavaScript code was a tangled mess that somehow worked, yet it contained some fascinating discoveries. One such revelation was realizing that setTimeout can accept a string as its first argument, effectively acting like eval. A decade ago, I knew this—but had since forgotten. Let’s call it 'lost ancient knowledge.
