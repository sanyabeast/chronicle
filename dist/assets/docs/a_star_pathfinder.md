# Exploring the AStarPathfinder Module

The `AStarPathfinder` module is a TypeScript implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm, which is widely used in computer science for finding the shortest path between two points. This implementation is generic, allowing it to be used with various types of data. Let's delve into its structure and functionalities.

## Overview of the Module

The module exports several types and a class, `AStarPathfinder`, which encapsulates the logic of the A* algorithm. Key components include:

- `FFindNeighbors`: A function type for finding neighboring cells.
- `FGetDistance`: A function type for calculating the distance between two cells.
- `Node`: Represents a node in the pathfinding process.
- `IAStarPathfinderParams`: Interface for pathfinder parameters.

## Class AStarPathfinder

The core of the module, `AStarPathfinder`, is a class that provides methods for pathfinding.

### Constructor

The constructor initializes the pathfinder with user-defined functions for finding neighbors and calculating distances, along with optional min and max range values.

### Methods

- `find_all_in_range(start: T)`: Finds all nodes within a specified range from the start node.
- `find_path(start: T, end: T)`: Finds the shortest path between two nodes.
- `add_neighbour(neighbor: T)`: Adds a neighbor to the current set of neighbors.
- `find_neighbors(cell: T, neighbors: Set<T>)`: Abstract method to find neighbors of a given cell.
- `prepare()`: Prepares the pathfinder for a new search.

### Properties

- `min_range` and `max_range`: Define the search range.
- `last_complexity` and `max_complexity`: Monitor the complexity of the pathfinding process.

## Use Cases

This module can be used in various scenarios, such as in games for AI pathfinding, in robotics for navigating through a space, or in applications that require route optimization.

## Conclusion

The `AStarPathfinder` module is a versatile and powerful tool for implementing the A* pathfinding algorithm in TypeScript projects. Its generic nature makes it applicable to a wide range of problems where pathfinding is essential.
