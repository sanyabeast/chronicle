The AStarPathfinder Vue component is an interactive tool designed for visualizing the A* pathfinding algorithm on a grid. It offers a hands-on experience for users to understand how pathfinding works. Key features include an interactive grid where users can set start and finish points, toggle cell states, and observe the algorithm's pathfinding in real time. The component is customizable, allowing users to adjust parameters like grid size, blockiness, and directional bias. It's also responsive, adapting to various screen sizes for accessibility. Primarily built with Vue.js and TypeScript, this component is suitable for educational purposes, helping users learn about pathfinding algorithms, or for developers needing a visual tool to demonstrate algorithmic navigation through a grid.
